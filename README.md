# Weather-Journal App Project

## Project Details
This project allows users to get current weather conditions by making use of API calls and asynchronous Javascript functions

## Process
This project was created by modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file provided by udacity.
An api call was made to an open weather website, where the current weather of a given location was fetched from.
Styling was then added to the page with the use of css.
No modifications was made to the html file.

### NOTE
More styling would still be done to this project to improve the UI
